 *Disclaimer: this is old and somewhat ugly code.*

This repository contains the replication material for _Oracle Efficient estimation and Forecasting with the Adaptive Lasso and the Adaptive Group Lasso in Vector Autoregressions_. All the computations are carried using *R*.

  1. SerenaDat contains a data frame with the transformed data ready for analysis. Read them with *read.table()*.
  2. fcNg-2.R is the main file estimating the models and producing the plots and tables in the paper.
  3. The remaining files contain functions called by fcNg-2.R.
